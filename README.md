# shimoku

All the project is donde in 1 Jupyter Notebook Divided in 3 sections. All the code is donde using python, shinoku and pandas
1 Env setup: All the neccessary enronment setup to work with the library
2 EDA: A simple exploratory data analisys of the dataset
3 Questions: Analisys on how to response the proposed questions in the challengue using the graphical tools provided by the shinoku library

I am not completly happy with the results, but given my available time and the constraints of the free version of the tool I think the final result is a good effort.
